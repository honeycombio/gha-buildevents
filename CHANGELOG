## v1.0.3 [2020-12-20[

### Enhancements

Several fixes and enhancements (again, thanks to [@DavidS](https://github.com/DavidS)!):

- Improved handling of `BUILDEVENT_FILE`:
  - If the file already exists, properties will be appended instead of overwriting the file #18
  - The file is created during the start section, because of this every span will contain the `github.*` fields, not just the last two
- The property `meta.source` is added to every span #19
- The trace ID is now unique, even when re-running a workflow #20
- Improved documentation and logging during run
