Several fixes and enhancements (again, thanks to [@DavidS](https://github.com/DavidS)!):

- Improved handling of `BUILDEVENT_FILE`:

  - The file is created during the start section, because of this every span will contain the `github.*` fields, not just the last two

- The trace ID is now unique, even when re-running a workflow #20
- Improved documentation and logging during run
